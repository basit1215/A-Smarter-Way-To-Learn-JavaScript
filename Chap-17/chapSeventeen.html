                Use the shift method to remove an element from the beginning of an array.
            </li>
            <li>
                To add one or more elements to the beginning of an array, use the unshift method.
            </li>
            <li>
                Use the splice method to insert one or more elements anywhere in an array, while
                optionally removing one or more elements that come after it.
            </li>
            <li>
                In Splice, you could allow additions without removing any elements.
            </li>
            <li>
                In Splice, you can also remove elements without adding any.
            </li>
            <li>
                Use the slice method to copy one or more consecutive elements in any position and put
                them into a new array.
            </li>
