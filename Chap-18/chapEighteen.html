            <li>
                A variable that counts iterations and also serves as the changing array index is declared
                and set to a starting value, in this case 0.
            </li>
            <li>
                The limit on the loop is defined. In this case, the loop is to keep running as long as the
counter doesn't exceed 4. Since the counter, in this case, is starting at 0, the loop will run
5 times
            </li>
            <li>
                What happens to the counter at the end of every loop. In this case, the counter is
incremented each time.

            </li>
            <li>
                What to call the counter (usually i) and what number to start it at (typically 0)
            </li>
            <li>
                How many loops to run (in this case, the number of elements in the array)
            </li>
            <li>
                How to change the counter after each iteration (typically to add 1 each time through)
            </li>
        </ul>
