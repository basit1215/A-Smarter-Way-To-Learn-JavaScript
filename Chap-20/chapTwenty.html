                The inner loop runs a complete cycle of iterations on each iteration of the outer loop. If
                the outer loop counter is i and the inner loop counter is j, j will loop through 0, 1, 2, and
                all the way to the end while i is on 0. Then i will increment to 1, and j will loop through
                all of its values again. The outer loop is the minute hand of a clock. The inner loop is the
                second hand.
