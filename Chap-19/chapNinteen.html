                This is unnecessary, since we got our
                answer in the second loop. The problem is solved with the keyword break

                If a match between the user's city and the
                list of cleanest cities is found, a confirming alert displays. But if there is no match, nothing
                happens. The user is left in the dark. If no match is found, we need to display an alert saying
                so. But how do we do that?
            </li>
            <li>
                We do it with a flag. A flag is just a variable that starts out with a default value that you
                give it, and then is switched to a different value under certain conditions.
